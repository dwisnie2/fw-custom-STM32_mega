## FAQ

### Q: What is this ?
A: This is an STM32F407VGT6 on an Arduino Mega socket board. It has 1 megabyte of flash, and can run both rusEFI and STM32Speeduino on existing installations that use Mega2560 board. There is a CAN PHY transciever on the board with CANTX/CANRX going to PD0/PD1, this is CAN0 ALT_2

### Q: What voltage dividers are used for analog inputs ?
A: 470 ohm and 1k ohm

### Q: What are the seven headers to solder?

A: the quick and lazy way: https://a.co/d/gqrhHuu,

A2: There are FIVE 1x8 , ONE 1x10, ONE 2x18 headers, they can be made up of normal cut to length 1x headers, and a 2x header with enough pins.

### Q: Are all the pins connected ?
A: no, Mega D46 is not connected, on 0.4 board that's earmarked for WMI EMPTY indicator.

### Q: What is the proper orientation of the header ?
